      <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
       <p>A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain name. Each web page of a given website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of clickable portion of text—that allow the user to move from one page of the website to another.The image below shows how a web page is created.</p>

       <p> Search engine is a web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) or through a web page. The image below shows The search button we use to look for things.</p>

       <p>The purpose of a website is to turn visitors into prospects. And the way to do this is to identify the major user types visiting your site, speak to their needs and give them a clear action step to take next.Let's look at a simple analogy — a public library. This is what you would generally do when visiting a library:</p>
    </div>
    
       <ul class="comparison-lists">
            <li>The library is like a web server. It has several sections, which is similar to a web server hosting multiple websites.</li>
            <li>The different sections (science, math, history, etc.) in the library are like websites. Each section is like a unique website (two sections do not contain same books).</li>
            <li>The books in each section are like webpages. One website may have several webpages, e.g., the Science section (the website) will have books on heat, sound, thermodynamics, statics, etc. (the webpages). Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL).s</li>
            <li>The search index is like the search engine. Each book has its own unique location in the library (two books cannot be kept at the same place) which is specified by the catalog number.</li>
